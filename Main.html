            <p>Coffee prepration is a process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, 
            the process includes the basic steps; raw coffee beans must be <a href="Roasting.html">roasted</a>, the roasted coffee beans must then be <a href="Grinding.html">ground</a>, the ground coffee mus then be mixed 
            with hot water for a certain time (<a href="Brewing.html">brewed</a>), and finally the liquid must be separated from the used grounds</p>
            <p>Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted and ground. Coffee is often 
            vacuum packed to prevent oxidaton and lengthen the shelf life.</p>
